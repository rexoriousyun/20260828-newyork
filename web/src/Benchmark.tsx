/**
 * How this trip compares with others of its length.
 *
 * "Goes wrong 1 trip in 214" is an analyst's number until there is something to
 * measure it against — Q-C's complaint about our whole unit vocabulary. The
 * ranking makes it a judgement, and the reference figure beside it keeps the
 * judgement checkable rather than asking the rider to take our word.
 *
 * Which side the comparison takes is decided on the server, where the bar lives
 * next to the data it is applied to. This file only chooses the words.
 *
 * The words are fifths, not percentages. A reference of a few hundred sampled
 * trips does not support "safer than 87% of trips this long", and a number that
 * precise invites a trust it has not earned (PR-08).
