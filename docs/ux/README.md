# UX Decision System

This directory is the project's **source of truth for why the product is the way it is.**

It exists so that product decisions are not opinions we re-argue every week. Each
decision points at a principle; each principle points at evidence. When evidence
changes, we walk the chain forward and revise the decisions it invalidates.

## The chain

```
Evidence (E-*) -> Problem (PR-*) -> Principle (P-*) -> Decision (D-*) -> Implementation
     ^                                                            |
     +---------------- new measurement / user research -----------+
```

## Files

| File | Holds | Stable IDs |
|---|---|---|
| `01-evidence.md` | Every factual claim we rely on, with its source and date | `E-D##` data, `E-L##` literature, `E-M##` market |
| `02-problems.md` | Rider problems, ranked, each tied to evidence | `PR-##` |
| `03-principles.md` | Design rules derived from evidence | `P-##` |
| `04-personas.md` | Who we build for, grounded in evidence | `U-##` |
| `05-journeys.md` | What they are doing when they reach us | `J-##` |
| `06-decisions.md` | What we chose, why, and what would reverse it | `D-##` |
| `07-flows.md` | Screen-level flows, and where the machinery hides | `F-##` |
| `08-research.md` | The protocol that closes `D-08`, with verdicts pre-registered | `Q-#` |

## Rules of the system

1. **No orphan decisions.** Every `D-##` cites at least one `P-##`. Every `P-##`
   cites at least one `E-*`. A decision with no chain is a preference, and gets
   labelled as one.
2. **Evidence has an expiry.** Each `E-*` records when it was measured. Data-derived
   evidence is re-run against fresh TTC data; if a number moves materially, every
   decision downstream of it is flagged for review.
3. **Decisions record their kill condition.** Each `D-##` states what observation
   would make us reverse it. A decision nobody can imagine reversing is usually
   an unexamined assumption.
4. **Superseded, never deleted.** Decisions are marked `Superseded by D-##`, so the
   reasoning history survives.

## Status

*Updated 2026-08-29.*

Seeded 2026-08-28 from the data investigation in `01-evidence.md`. **35 decisions, 9
principles, 14 problems, 3 personas, 5 journeys and 4 flows**, each traceable to the
measurement that produced it. Two audits reversed the design they were written to confirm,
and both reversals are still in the log.

Personas remain **provisional** — derived from published research and our own delay
analysis, not yet from interviews with Toronto riders. Validating them is `D-08`, and it is
now the only thing this project is blocked on: everything buildable without a realtime feed
is built. The protocol is written and pre-registered in `08-research.md`.
