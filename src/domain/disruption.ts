/**
 * What today's alerts actually say.
 *
 * The TTC populates every alert with `UNKNOWN_EFFECT`, so the feed's own enum
 * is useless and the meaning has to come from the description text. The text is
 * consistent enough to read:
 *
 *   "506 Carlton: Detour via Ossington Ave, Dundas St W and Bay St
 *    due to a blocked track."
 *
 * A route prefix, a kind, the change, and a cause. This module reads the kind
 * and the cause and refuses to guess anything else — notably the *extent* of a
 * closure, which is written as prose ("between Queens Quay Loop at Lower
 * Spadina Ave and Union Station Streetcar Platform") and would have to be
 * matched back to stops. Getting that wrong would strand a rider on a leg we
 * told them was fine, so it is left unparsed and the whole route is flagged.
