/**
 * Reliability scoring for a whole journey.
 *
 * The engine measures a *segment*. This turns a sequence of legs into what a
 * rider actually wants: how long this trip usually takes, and how long it takes
 * when it goes wrong.
 *
 * Two conversions make that honest:
 *
 *   per-month -> per-trip   exposure is harm over calendar time, so it is
 *                           divided by how often the segment is served
 *                           (`frequency.ts`), or frequent routes are punished
 *                           for being frequent.
 *
 *   risk -> minutes         a per-trip incident probability is multiplied by
 *                           the pooled severity for that mode (`D-11`), because
 *                           severity does not persist per segment.
 *
 * The output is a range, never a single number (`P-01`).
