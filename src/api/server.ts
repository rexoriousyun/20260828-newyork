 * the app, the API and the tiles, which is what `tiles.ts` has always assumed
 * when it builds absolute sprite URLs from the request origin.
 *
 * Stripping it here rather than re-declaring every route under a prefix keeps
 * one definition of each route, and `rewriteUrl` runs before routing, which an
 * `onRequest` hook does not. The dev proxy no longer rewrites either, so both
 * environments now take the same path through this function — the difference

 * Compress every response.

 * browser: **7.1 s to first paint on slow 4G, 20.9 s on 3G**, against 2.2 s and
 * 5.9 s once gzipped. A `/plan` response goes 185 KB -> 20 KB; the route
 * ranking 120 KB -> 12 KB; the map style 43 KB -> 3.8 KB.
 *
 * Two reasons this is not merely a speed fix:
 *
 * - `U-02` is standing at a stop, in winter, on whatever signal the shelter
 *   gets. Seven seconds of blank screen is the difference between an app they
 *   use and one they close.
 * - `PR-14` records that this product excludes part of the audience it claims
 *   to serve — 66.6% of TTC riders are equity-deserving, and lower-income
 *   riders pay per ride because they cannot front a monthly pass. Sending a
 *   quarter of a megabyte where twenty kilobytes would do spends *their* data.
 *
 * Brotli is not enabled. It compresses a little better and costs noticeably
 * more CPU per response on a shared vCPU, and the gain over gzip here is
 * single-digit percent on payloads already reduced tenfold.
